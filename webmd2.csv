Xerese,"genital herpes, recurrent cold sore, an infection due to a virus",Acyclovir-Hydrocortisone Cream,Acyclovir-Hydrocortisone,"Read the Patient Information Leaflet if available from your pharmacist before you start using this medication and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.Use this medication at the first sign of a cold sore. Wash your hands with soap and water before and after applying this medication. Clean and dry the affected area before applying the medication. Apply a thin layer on the affected area as directed by your doctor, usually 5 times a day (every 3 to 4 hours) for 5 days. Apply enough cream to cover all affected areas. Do not rub the area because it may spread to other areas around your mouth or make your cold sore worse. Do not apply other skin products (including make-up, sunscreen, or lip balm) or cover the affected area with a bandage. To prevent washing off the medication, do not bathe, shower, or swim for 30 minutes after application.Do not apply this medication in the eyes or nose, inside the mouth, or on the genitals.Cold sores (herpes) can spread easily. Acyclovir/hydrocortisone cream does not prevent the spread of herpes. Avoid sharing eating utensils, cups, razors, or towels during an outbreak. Also, try not to touch the cold sore (including kissing), and wash your hands if you do touch the cold sore.Use this product regularly to get the most benefit from it. Tell your doctor if your condition persists or worsens after 2 weeks.","This medication contains 2 ingredients: acyclovir and hydrocortisone. It is used to treat cold sores/fever blisters caused by a virus (herpes simplex). Acyclovir is an antiviral medication that works by stopping the growth of the virus. Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid that helps relieve itching, pain, and burning symptoms. This medication can speed up healing of cold sores, but it does not cure herpes or prevent passing the infection to someone else. It also does not prevent cold sores from returning."
Sitavig,a cold sore,"Acyclovir Tablet, Buccal, Muco-Adhesive",Acyclovir,"Read the Patient Information Leaflet and Instructions for Use provided by your pharmacist before you start using acyclovir buccal tablets and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.Apply one tablet within one hour after you have the first symptom of a cold sore, and before a cold sore appears. Symptoms may include itching, redness, burning, or tingling. Apply the tablet on the same side of your mouth as the cold sore symptoms.Before applying the tablet, find the area in your mouth in which to place the tablet. It should be placed on the upper gum, just above the left or right incisor tooth. The incisors are the teeth just to the left and right of your two front teeth. With dry hands, remove one tablet from the blister pack and place it in your mouth with the round side facing against your gum and gently push it into place. Remove your hand from inside your mouth and gently press your finger on the outside of your upper lip for 30 seconds. This will make the tablet stick to your gum. The tablet will slowly dissolve over time and should be left in place. You may eat and drink while using this medication. Do not crush, chew, suck, or swallow the tablet.If the tablet does not stick to your upper gum or falls off within the first 6 hours after you apply it, the same tablet should be placed back onto your upper gum right away. If it still does not stay in place, apply another acyclovir tablet to your upper gum.If you accidentally swallow the tablet within the first 6 hours after placement, drink a glass of water and apply a new dose to your gum. However, if the tablet has been in place 6 hours or longer and it falls out or you swallow it, do not re-apply the tablet.Avoid doing things that may keep the buccal tablet from sticking to your gum, including touching or pressing the tablet after placement, wearing an upper denture that interferes with tablet placement, chewing gum, and brushing your teeth while the tablet is in place. You may gently rinse your mouth with water to clean your teeth while the tablet is in place. Drink plenty of liquids if you have dry mouth.This medication works best when started at the first sign of a cold sore, as directed by your doctor. It may not work as well if you delay treatment.Tell your doctor if your condition does not improve or if it worsens.","This medication is used to treat cold sores around the mouth (caused by herpes virus) that keep coming back.Acyclovir is an antiviral drug. However, it is not a cure for the infection. The virus that causes infection continues to live in the body between outbreaks. Acyclovir makes outbreaks shorter and less severe. It helps the sores heal faster, keeps new sores from forming, and decreases pain/itching. This medication may also help reduce how long pain lasts after the sores heal."

Emollients are substances that soften and moisturize the skin and decrease itching and flaking. Some products (e.g., zinc oxide, white petrolatum) are used mostly to protect the skin against irritation (e.g., from wetness).Dry skin is caused by a loss of water in the upper layer of the skin. Emollients/moisturizers work by forming an oily layer on the top of the skin that traps water in the skin. Petrolatum, lanolin, mineral oil and dimethicone are common emollients. Humectants, including glycerin, lecithin, and propylene glycol, draw water into the outer layer of skin. Many products also have ingredients that soften the horny substance (keratin) that holds the top layer of skin cells together (including urea, alpha hydroxy acids such as lactic/citric/glycolic acid, and allantoin). This helps the dead skin cells fall off, helps the skin keep in more water, and leaves the skin feeling smoother and softer."

Emollients are substances that soften and moisturize the skin and decrease itching and flaking. Some products (e.g., zinc oxide, white petrolatum) are used mostly to protect the skin against irritation (e.g., from wetness).Dry skin is caused by a loss of water in the upper layer of the skin. Emollients/moisturizers work by forming an oily layer on the top of the skin that traps water in the skin. Petrolatum, lanolin, mineral oil and dimethicone are common emollients. Humectants, including glycerin, lecithin, and propylene glycol, draw water into the outer layer of skin. Many products also have ingredients that soften the horny substance (keratin) that holds the top layer of skin cells together (including urea, alpha hydroxy acids such as lactic/citric/glycolic acid, and allantoin).

Emollients are substances that soften and moisturize the skin and decrease itching and flaking. Some products (e.g., zinc oxide, white petrolatum) are used mostly to protect the skin against irritation (e.g., from wetness).Dry skin is caused by a loss of water in the upper layer of the skin. Emollients/moisturizers work by forming an oily layer on the top of the skin that traps water in the skin. Petrolatum, lanolin, mineral oil and dimethicone are common emollients. Humectants, including glycerin, lecithin, and propylene glycol, draw water into the outer layer of skin. Many products also have ingredients that soften the horny substance (keratin) that holds the top layer of skin cells together (including urea, alpha hydroxy acids such as lactic/citric/glycolic acid, and allantoin). This helps the dead skin cells fall off, helps the skin keep in more water, and leaves the skin feeling smoother and softer."
